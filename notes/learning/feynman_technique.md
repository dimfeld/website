Notes on [The Feynman Technique: The Best Way to Learn Anything](https://fs.blog/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/)

This boils down to the idea that the best way to learn something is to explain it as simply as possible. If you struggle to explain a concept without resorting to jargon or complicated language, that’s a sign that you don’t truly understand it.

Once you’ve written your explanation, go through it and see which parts still seem vague or over complicated, and take the time to understand those parts until you can explain them plainly.

Continue this until you have the entire concept written out simply. Optionally you can read your explanation to another person and see how they understand it.
