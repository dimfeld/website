Main Note: [Deliberate Practice](deliberate_practice)

# Lessons from practice under a master teacher
* Great coaches are, themselves, experts in the exact thing theyâ€™re teaching
* Immediate feedback, noting both improvements and mistakes.
* Plain language instead of jargon, to allow a more intuitive understanding of the topic.
* Actively engage on the response to the feedback to ensure understanding.

# What is a master?
Masters have a good mental model of their domain.  They have learned to automatically notice the important details, such as soccer players mapping out the positions of players on a field when watching a game without explicitly thinking about it.

## Representations
These are the facts, images, and patterns that allow a master to quickly assess and respond to a situation. They allow him to quickly process large amounts of information without the limitations of short term memory.
