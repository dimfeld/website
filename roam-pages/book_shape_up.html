    <li id="syWGPfB0b">These notes are heavily based on highlights of the Shape Up book. Since the book is freely available, I&#39;ve just included many of my highlights here verbatim and marked them with blockquotes. All images are also taken from the book.</li>
    <li id="d4iJYKEzJ">The Shape Up process proceeds one six-week cycle at a time, with a week or two in between each interval for various maintenance tasks and to prepare the next cycle.
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="AZXdjL0h9"><blockquote class="rm-bq">No backlogs, no Kanban, no velocity tracking, none of that.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="DOsVzjy6v">If a project doesn&#39;t get approved for a six-week cycle, it is not automatically proposed again. After six weeks if you still think it&#39;s worth doing you can propose it again.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="eW1s-kxsL">Product design involves <em class="rm-italics">shaping</em> the work, which gives us enough detail to know what to make and roughly how to do it, without being overly prescriptive.
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="lAR963fh2"><blockquote class="rm-bq">When design leaders go straight to wireframes or high-fidelity mockups, they define too much detail too early. This leaves designers no room for creativity.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="v_rezbSc5"><blockquote class="rm-bq">On the other end of the spectrum, projects that are too vague don’t work either... You have to be a mind reader.</blockquote></li>

      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="WDWL8ETW2">Shaping builds a feature based on how the user interacts with the product. It sketches out the UI/UX and how the new screens interact with existing software features.</li>
        <li id="tdnOjyzaH"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Work on the shaping track is kept private and not shared with the wider team until the commitment has been made to bet on it. That gives the shapers the option to put work-in-progress on the shelf or drop it when it’s not working out.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="UReOd-D9w"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Work in the shaping stage is rough. Everyone can tell by looking at it that it’s unfinished. They can see the open spaces where their contributions will go.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="dljfgCdcu"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Despite being rough and unfinished, shaped work has been thought through. All the main elements of the solution are there at the macro level and they connect together.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="_1MXXC63d"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Lastly, shaped work indicates what not to do. It tells the team where to stop. There’s a specific appetite—the amount of time the team is allowed to spend on the project.</blockquote></li>

      <ol class="list-numbered">
        <li id="hX65kyRLu"><blockquote class="rm-bq"><strong class="rm-bold">Set boundaries.</strong> First we figure out how much time the raw idea is worth and how to define the problem. This gives us the basic boundaries to shape into.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="fPE6fsSNO"><blockquote class="rm-bq"><strong class="rm-bold">Rough out the elements.</strong> Then comes the creative work of sketching a solution. We do this at a higher level of abstraction than wireframes in order to move fast and explore a wide enough range of possibilities. The output of this step is an idea that solves the problem within the appetite but without all the fine details worked out.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="oFdKGI8ZG"><blockquote class="rm-bq"><strong class="rm-bold">Address risks and rabbit holes.</strong> Once we think we have a solution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered questions that could trip up the team. We amend the solution, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain tricky spots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="yXSCYzq72"><blockquote class="rm-bq"><strong class="rm-bold">Write the pitch</strong>. Once we think we’ve shaped it enough to potentially bet on, we package it with a formal write-up called a pitch . The pitch summarizes the problem, constraints, solution, rabbit holes, and limitations. The pitch goes to the betting table for consideration. If the project gets chosen, the pitch can be re-used at kick-off to explain the project to the team.</blockquote></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="15rUsa8mh"><blockquote class="rm-bq">It helps to explicitly define how much of our time and attention the subject deserves. Is this something worth a quick fix if we can manage? Is it a big idea worth an entire cycle? Would we redesign what we already have to accommodate it? Will we only consider it if we can implement it as a minor tweak?</blockquote></li>
    <li id="E9S9-DAWz"><blockquote class="rm-bq">We call this the <strong class="rm-bold">appetite</strong>. You can think of the appetite as a time budget for a standard team size. We usually set the appetite in two sizes: </blockquote>
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="l3_wNJ8Xd">Small Batch projects take a week or two to finish for a team of two or three people. 
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li id="sQD7syqfI">Teams working on small batch projects for a cycle will work on multiple projects in the same cycle. </li>
            <li id="UVtbVDe4b">The individual projects within the cycle are not scheduled more finely than that. The team figures out the best way to deliver them all by the end of the cycle.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="7bIKnW8MP">Big Batch projects take the entire six-week cycle for just one project.</li>
        <li id="cxbKTn3e7"><blockquote class="rm-bq"><strong class="rm-bold">Fixed time, variable scope</strong> An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design.</blockquote></li>

      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="UWq7ytrYB"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Our default response to any idea that comes up should be: “Interesting. Maybe some day.” In other words, a very soft “no” that leaves all our options open.</blockquote>

            <li id="r58CIVo4N">There is value in this, but at the same time it can lead to ignoring things that your customers want for too long. This may work for Basecamp but I see it as more of a guideline to not commit to things too soon instead of a real rule to follow.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="uGajJu8EE"><blockquote class="rm-bq">It’s important to keep a cool manner and a bit of a poker face. We don’t want to shut down an idea that we don’t understand. New information might come in tomorrow that makes us see it differently. On the other hand, showing too much enthusiasm right away can set expectations that this thing is going to happen.</blockquote></li>

            <li id="d6-SHmSCA"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Writing out the flows confronts us with questions we didn’t originally think of and stimulates design ideas without distracting us with unimportant visual choices.</blockquote></li>
            <li id="DdbmUjThG">There are three things we draw during breadboarding:
              <ol class="list-numbered">
                <li id="3-I8RUcYQ"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Places: These are things you can navigate to, like screens, dialogs, or menus that pop up.</blockquote></li>
                <li id="x09UmxWtA"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Affordances: These are things the user can act on, like buttons and fields. We consider interface copy to be an affordance, too. Reading it is an act that gives the user information for subsequent actions.</blockquote></li>
                <li id="vwVyot08G"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Connection lines: These show how the affordances take the user from place to place. We’ll use words for everything instead of pictures. The important things are the components we’re identifying and their connections.</blockquote></li>

            <li id="6oOKX4H0W">For more visual ideas, it may work better to actually draw pictures instead of just breadboarding.</li>
            <li id="clUg769Fo">The real idea here is to use a marker thick enough (on paper, tablet, or whatever) that you can&#39;t draw any real detail. Just enough to give people the idea without designing too much in advance.
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li id="hFi0hzeZ5">This helps with quick iterations, letting you put together a bunch of possibilities really quick without getting bogged down in colors or exact positioning.</li>
                <li id="fuAK87tee">It also prevents you from doing too much design work in your proposal, when that sort of thing is better left to the people actually implementing the feature.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="KKE4IZhrq">The work you do while shaping doesn&#39;t have to make sense to anyone else at first. It just has to help you &quot;add value to a raw idea&quot; until you can decide generally what it should look like and if you think it&#39;s worth committing to.</li>

        <li id="C0JJjFoOC"><blockquote class="rm-bq">Then we should also question the viability of each part we think we solved.</blockquote>
          <ul class="list-bullet">

Instead of grouping or segmenting them, we would just append the name of the group…</blockquote></li>
            <li id="3mqu2R4uA"><blockquote class="rm-bq">This is the kind of trade-off that’s difficult to make when you’re working inside the cycle under pressure.</blockquote></li>
            <li id="3cqKqR5j3"><blockquote class="rm-bq">As shapers, we’re thinking less about the ultimate design and more about basic quality and risk. With the compromised concept we get to keep all the elements that made the project worth doing—the groups of incomplete items—and we get to cut off a big tail of risk.</blockquote></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="47wwR9dgo">Once you have thought about a risk and how to deal with it, you can specifically point it out in the project proposal to give some direction to the people who will implement it.</li>
        <li id="51uuSdxEg">You should also explicitly note any features that <em class="rm-italics">do not</em> fall under the scope of the project, to ensure that the project can be done within the appetite for it.</li>
        <li id="oERTT2eEx">While shaping is largely a private process, it can be very useful to show it to teammates well-versed in certain aspects of the feature. They may identify problematic aspects or have ideas on how to approach it in a simpler manner.</li>
