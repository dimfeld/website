                <li id="f-f0X1R4E">Moves that take too many operations may be very slow to converge and actually require more time than the exact solution in some cases.</li>

              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li id="6YB1eLvNr">Often moves are ordered by the complexity of their application. Some variants apply all the moves at once, so long as descent is made for some neighborhood in the series.</li>

        </li>
        <li id="SbDGsT9pH">As an example, we might have two neighborhood structures. The first does a greedy search for placing a new facility and the other does an interchange, moving an existing facility elsewhere. These two would be applied in turn until the algorithm halts. </li>

            <li id="N81Y-iCMf">How far?
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li id="OzQ7tx1pv">Since local minima tend to be close together, we should start with small steps.</li>

            <li id="u9jiDd627">If the moves don’t get us out of the valley, how do we modify them?
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li id="RFknsj4QE">Go farther! Usually this takes the form of each of the neighborhood structures building upon the previous one to create a larger or more complex move (this is called nesting).</li>

          <ul class="list-document">
            <li id="E4jMRgpy-">Init: Select neighborhoods N (1 to kmax), initial solution x, stopping condition.</li>

      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="i5ZkOVWWC">This is the general one to use when you don’t have a specific reason to do otherwise. It is similar to the basic VNS, but uses VND as the local search step. We may use different neighborhood selections for the shaking step and the VND step, but it is not required.</li>

      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="zwmfe9sls">Some problems have local minima that are spaced far apart, and so if we happen to jump into one we probably want to explore around there.</li>
        <li id="l30C0H9Oc">With an extremely large neighborhood, we might jump into one of these other minima, and so it can be desirable to try out a not-quite-the-best solution if it’s sufficiently far away from the current best solution.</li>
        <li id="5DPTukiub">In this method, after we move we check if the candidate solution is better than or worse-but-within-a-tolerance of the best solution, and if it is then we move the search space to it.</li>
        <li id="lsUWe4qeG">Throughout the process, we remember the best solution even if we’re not currently looking at it.</li>
        <li id="f_8euD8Ue">Should we do this?
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li id="qnL7wNmK0">The easiest way to answer the question is to run VNS for a short period of time from a bunch of different starting conditions and see if they end up in very different states with good solutions.</li>
