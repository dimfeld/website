  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li id="OQU5MSCkl">A common problem is too wide line length on content which hurts readability. 35-75 characters is a good target for this.
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="f_jqlF_xp">Can do this by increasing margin or font size.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="n5nvmjoEV">Bigger line height helps too.
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="pzTcyiow8">1.4 to 1.7em helps for content, but should reduce as font size increases</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="9l8sHW037">Sometimes headlines should use smaller sizes on mobile to reduce excessive wrapping.</li>
    <li id="fLki724fb">Dark gray is good for paragraphs, which leaves black for the headers so they stand out.</li>
    <li id="DSQ3LJ0KJ">Line spacing should be set so that elements are attached to the relevant items. For example, a date and location would be closer to the headline it&#39;s attached to than to the rest of the content.</li>
    <li id="SDHB7YPNM">Lists
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="RD4oWjYF1">Lists benefit from greater line height and custom bullets.</li>
        <li id="kbBVXDGXx">Use custom bullet images and alight them with the left side of the header text for the list.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="E2H5lMzfR">A nice trick is to make the background a gradient, which starts out white at the top for better contrast with the header and slow fade to gray for smoother contrast with inputs later down the page. </li>
  </ul>
