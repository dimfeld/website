    <li>Past Businesses

        <li>Bingo Card Creator
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>This was a B2C which was very hard to do as a small entrepreneur.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Appointment Reminder
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>This was the next venture, after Patrick had quit his job.</li>
            <li>It was the &quot;great business idea but I have no passion for it&quot; type of idea, and this was a mistake as well because there wasn&#39;t much to keep up the motivation in the hard times.</li>
            <li>Patrick did consulting at the same time too.</li>
          </ul>

        <li>Traffic is hardest to optimize for,</li>
        <li>Conversion rate is easier but takes a while to see results.</li>
        <li>ARPU (average revenue per user) is easy, and can be changed with a few minutes of work</li>
        <li>Churn requires working on retention of existing users</li>
        <li>See 2011 presentations from Rob Walling and Patrick</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Charge more
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Appointment Reminder started at $9, $29, $79, and enterprise &quot;call me for price&quot; plan</li>
        <li>Dropped the $9 plan and added  a $199 &quot;office&quot; plan, and revenue went up 60% in 2 months.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Lifecycle Emails
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>This is different from a drip campaign because you the recipient is already a customer or in a trial. This is basically an email designed to trigger an upsell or conversion. </li>
        <li>It requires some thinking about what your funnel looks like and the right time to send these emails.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Annual Billing
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>To add it after your business exists:</li>
        <li>Offer a discount (1 month free) if they switch to annual</li>
        <li>Offer to &quot;loyal customers&quot; over email</li>
        <li>Make it easy to switch, 1-button click</li>
        <li>When you have happy customers, this gives the impression of free money to the customer.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Upsell Tiers
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>When you have usage tiers and your customers are close to their quota:</li>
        <li>Send an empathetic email about it</li>
        <li>Upgrade with a discount for &quot;peace of mind&quot;.</li>
        <li>Example
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>1. Query for everyone within 20% of their quota on some features</li>
            <li>2. Add in extra special offer plans at a slight discount (say 20%) to &quot;make it an easy decision for you&quot;.</li>
            <li>3. Write a two paragraph email referencing the upgrades from one plan to the next.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Internal Dashboards
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Just run some queries to look for interesting patterns</li>
        <li>heavy usage, light usage</li>
        <li>Upcoming plan renewal</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Trials
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Look at the differences between those who convert and those who don&#39;t. e.g. for Appointment Reminder the converted customers used the product a lot and the cancelled trials used it lightly or not at all.</li>
        <li>So what goes into those &quot;lightly or not at all&quot; trials?</li>
        <li>Was the product not useful?</li>
        <li>Did they have trouble figuring it out?</li>
        <li>Managing Trial Users
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>An email sequence can help with these things.</li>
            <li>Auto generated welcome
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Establish expectations. </li>
                <li>Recommend checking out the tutorial and also using it actively on their own needs.</li>
                <li>Personal touch &quot;If you email me, I will personally read it and can do my best to help you&quot;</li>
                <li>Personal Welcome</li>
                <li>Announce availability</li>
                <li>Ask then to email you</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Trial Check-in
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>For a good trial, sell them on conversion. </li>
                <li>Simple ROI calculation with money saved.</li>
                <li>Offer to close now with personal consultation or something.</li>
                <li>For a bad trial, try to rescue it.
                  <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>If they didn&#39;t use it, try to find out why.
                      <ul class="list-bullet">
                        <li>Sympathize with them being busy</li>
                        <li>Ask if they had trouble with anything</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Offer to extend trial
                      <ul class="list-bullet">
                        <li>Not great conversion rate on this but it is very valuable</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Great opportunity for customer development, finding out where your product might be falling short</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>End of Trial
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Send an email a few days before the trial ends, letting them know and that the credit card charge is coming up</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Weekly Checkup
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Put in some ROI calculation from the week if you can.
                  <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>You did this much stuff and saved this much money!</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This makes it easy to continue justifying the price they&#39;re paying for your product.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Account Investigation
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Have a per-customer dashboard with some recent usage (anonymized as necessary) and with month-over-month and lifetime usage stats.</li>
        <li>This way you can see when a good customer cancels or just their credit card fails to approve.</li>
        <li>Call them if you can. &quot;Just want to get the new card info to make sure your account doesn&#39;t get cut off.&quot;</li>
        <li>And if that doesn&#39;t work, send a friendly email letting them know that the credit card didn&#39;t go through and give a 3-day grace period.</li>
        <li>Follow up each day.</li>
        <li>After that, send an email letting them know you &quot;took the liberty of pausing your account.&quot;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Thoughts on Consulting
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Scaling Consulting
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Increase your rates</li>
            <li>Hire people</li>
            <li>Improve how often you get contracts and get paid</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reasons to Not Consult
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Constantly looking for new clients. (Ideally you repeat business with existing clients)</li>
            <li>Lots of unpaid administrative work (billing, talking to lawyers, etc.)</li>
            <li>You have a boss and have to go to work and do planning meetings and stuff</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Replacing Consulting with a Software Business
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>It can take years to become profitable, if ever.</li>
            <li>Revenue can be very spiky.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How to Get Out of Consulting?
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Productize your consulting service</li>
            <li>Basically take the thing you do for people and take &quot;you&quot; out of it.</li>
            <li>This can be a book, a course, or even training events.</li>
            <li>Patrick&#39;s &quot;Non-software Product&quot;
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>In consulting, customers would need help with email and Patrick would set them up with drip and lifecycle emails.
                  <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>This generally took a lot of sales, a little bit of coding, and some copywriting (by a self-proclaimed &quot;not great&quot; copywriter).</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>So why would a customer buy a book about this when they could just hire the consultant?
                  <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>$500 instead of $20K-ish</li>
                    <li>Don&#39;t have to find a consultant</li>
                    <li>Don&#39;t know if you have the time to really act on it yet.
                      <ul class="list-bullet">
                        <li>A lot of companies aren&#39;t really. able to get everyone in the same room for a few days just to focus on email marketing.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cheap easy way to get into email marketing without going all-in</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Why not just get it for free from blogs?
                  <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Real businesses spend money on their problems</li>
                    <li>&quot;Free&quot; takes longer to research than just buying a package, and &quot;free&quot; isn&#39;t free when you&#39;re paying employees</li>
                    <li>In larger orgs, putting money into something indicates seriousness and quality of the initiative to those that might otherwise object.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How to do it
                  <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Started building an email list a few months in advance</li>
                    <li>Focused 75% on teaching, 25% on the upcoming product</li>
                    <li>Sent just 2 sales emails which linked to a long landing page with more details</li>
                    <li>Landing Page
                      <ul class="list-bullet">
                        <li>Establish value proposition early</li>
                        <li>Unusual phrases in copywriting attract attention 
                          <ul class="list-bullet">
                            <li>&quot;unreasonable amounts of money&quot;</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Case Study on how the techniques work
                          <ul class="list-bullet">
                            <li>Assuming you&#39;re coming from a consulting career, use one of those</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Personal testimonial</li>
                        <li>Acknowledge and answer objections</li>
                        <li>List the benefits of the course. 
                          <ul class="list-bullet">
                            <li>What it will do for you is more important than the table of contents and all that.</li>
                            <li><a href="/notes/jobs_to_be_done">Jobs to be Done</a> style</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Multiple Pricing Tiers
                      <ul class="list-bullet">
                        <li>He did a single user and team license for 4x as much.</li>
                        <li>Nathan Barry (ConvertKit) had three tiers. 
                          <ul class="list-bullet">
                            <li>Focus was on what you get, not on the prices</li>
                            <li>Started with the expensive one so you see all the stuff first and go &quot;less&quot; from there.</li>
                            <li>Most sales were for the highest tier.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The product
                  <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Speaking into a webcam and decent microphone. Would add slides next time.</li>
                    <li>Partnered with people with related interests</li>
                    <li>Made $65K as of the time of the video. Two thirds of that was in the first month.
                      <ul class="list-bullet">
                        <li>This is actually pretty good ROI since it took about the same amount of time as a consulting gig but paid about 2-3x the amount and didn&#39;t require a bunch of contract negotiation, etc.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                <li>Keys to success
                  <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>An active email list is very important</li>
                    <li>Target a pain point you <strong class="font-bold">know</strong> there is a demand for</li>
                    <li>Work on your copy. (See <a href="https://copyhackers.com">Copyhackers</a>)</li>
