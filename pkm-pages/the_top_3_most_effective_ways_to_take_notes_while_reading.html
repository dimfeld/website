        <li>Highlight and write notes as you read. After each chapter, write a summary and include personal application if you can.</li>
        <li>Once you’re done with the book, wait a week and then go back through your notes. This gives your mind time to process the book. Save anything that still seems worth remembering. Perhaps create a small overall summary of the book, covering both its main arguments and the gaps therein.</li>
        <li>Incorporate the notes into your larger system.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><blockquote>To aid recall, connect the ideas to something you already have in your mind. Is it a continuation of the idea? Does it replace an idea? Is it the same idea in a different discipline? I add these connections to my notes and percolate them in my mind. Often I turn out to be mistaken but that’s the process.</blockquote></li>
  </ul>
