    <p>Implemented my first Rust future by hand today for <a href="/notes/projects_effectum">Effectum</a> . Wasnâ€™t too bad actually, for simple cases. I ended up going a different route but it was nice to get the experience. The main job waiter loop is coming together, and next up will be adding new jobs and pulling them off the queue to assign to workers.</p>
    <p>I switched back from Warp to iTerm2+tmux once again. There are still some rough edges with Neovim, but overall Warp has improved a lot in the past six months and I&#39;m looking forward to the next time I try it again.</p>
