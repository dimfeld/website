    <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>Hit an unusual problem today where reading pixels back from a <code>canvas</code> HTML element won&#39;t always give you the same value you wrote, if Brave&#39;s anti-fingerprinting measures are on. (Anti-aliasing is an issue too, but we knew about that already.) I remember reading something about how browser-fingerprinting libraries can sometimes use techniques like this to determine unique users, but was baffled for a while until turning off Brave&#39;s privacy features made the bug go away.</p>
