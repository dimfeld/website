    <li>We have a fair amount of legacy code at work which we&#39;re slowly converting to modernity, and one aspect of that is making Typescript pass in <code>strict</code> mode. I&#39;ve found it useful to enable strict mode in the main <code>tsconfig.json</code>, while using a second <code>tsconfig</code> file to actually build the project that extends from the main file but turns off strict mode. This way we can still run checks and get the full set of diagnostics when developing, while allowing the build to still pass.</li>

Looks like the utility needed to accomplish it doesn&#39;t work on Mac, but this seems like something most used on remote servers anyway.</li>
