    <p>Time to start up Ergo once again! I upgraded to the latest version of SvelteKit and some of the backend dependencies as well. Upgrading Deno&#39;s core packages through about 50 versions when you&#39;re using internal undocumented stuff was slightly tricky, but fortunately their code is quite readable so I was able to update mine to match.</p>
    <p>Next up, I&#39;m going to play with various ways of compiling UIs down to state machines to perform tasks.</p>
