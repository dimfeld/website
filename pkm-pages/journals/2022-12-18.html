  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>Finally switched my blog to self-host the fonts. Seems like some improvement on the &quot;flash of unstyled content&quot; but it&#39;s still there somewhat with <code>font-display: swap</code>. I&#39;m giving it a try with that left unset, which means the text area is briefly blank on first load, but that feels less jarring than actually swapping the fonts.</li>

  </ul>
