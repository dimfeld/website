  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>Implemented job recovery in <a href="/notes/projects_prefect">Prefect</a> today, so that if the process restarts unexpectedly the jobs can be retried. I also did a bit of cleanup to prepare for the eventual addition of a server mode. The aim is to allow switching from an embedded task queue to one hosted on a server, and not have to significantly change the API, so that you can keep complexity down at first but then scale up with minimal fuss when necessary.</li>
    <li><a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a> is now running on <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum">Axum</a> 0.6, which was just released. For the feature set I was using, it was a pretty seamless change. I like that there&#39;s a lot more clarity now between extractors that consume the request body (e.g. Json parsing) and those that don&#39;t touch it at all.</li>

  </ul>
