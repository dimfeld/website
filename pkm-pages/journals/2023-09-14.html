    <p>So my latest side project is Buzzy, an AI assistant geared toward answering my kids&#39; questions. They like talking to Alexa but it frequently gives irrelevant results, so I&#39;m hoping to give them something both smarter and more fun.</p>
    <p>Any voice assistant needs wake word detection and while it would be fun to train my own model here, <a href="https://picovoice.ai">PicoVoice</a> works great out of the box. A tad expensive if you&#39;re a solopreneur without a budget, but totally free for personal use.</p>
    <p>Buzzy lives at <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/buzzy">https://github.com/dimfeld/buzzy</a> and I&#39;ll continue updating here as things get going!</p>
