    <p>I&#39;ve been reorganizing my code snippets repo, and among other things I&#39;ve updated my dark mode support for modern SvelteKit.</p>
    <p>This supports SSR by persisting both the user&#39;s choice and the default setting in cookies, to avoid that &quot;flash of light&quot;. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/snippets/blob/master/svelte/theme.ts">here</a>.</p>
    <p>I also set up CI and websites for <a href="https://promptbox.imfeld.dev">PromptBox</a> and <a href="https://sqlweld.imfeld.dev">sqlweld</a>, where they can easily be downloaded.</p>

        <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-express-one-zone-high-performance-storage-class/">AWS announced a new S3 storage tier</a> designed for low-latency analytics among other things. If I ever start working on <a href="/notes/projects_smelter">Smelter</a> again this will be useful. 7x the cost of normal S3 but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s worth it for certain systems.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.placekey.io/">Placekey</a> looks like a nice solution for address entity resolution. It has a generous free tier and cheap paid tiers as well. Heard about it on from <a href="https://mapscaping.com/podcast/entity-resolution-with-placekey/">the Mapscaping Podcast</a>.</li>
