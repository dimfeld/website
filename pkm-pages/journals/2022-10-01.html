  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>Starting yet another side project because why not :) <a href="/notes/projects_prefect">Prefect</a> will be a SQLite-based task queue embeddable via a Rust library, and eventually it will also be a standalone project, which can be used over HTTP or gRPC. Just putting together the requirements now. This is mostly an excuse to play with SQLite a bit, but once this is in decent condition I&#39;ll probably start using it for both <a href="/notes/projects_ergo">Ergo</a> and <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a>.</li>

  </ul>
