    <p>I created a small utility named <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/sqlweld">sqlweld</a> for assembling SQL query files from liquid templates with partials, so I can get statically-defined queries while still allowing reuse for common things like permissions checks. This way I can write raw SQL in my projects while still getting code reuse on my queries.</p>
    <p>The first real use of this will be on <a href="/notes/projects_glance">Glance</a>, which I&#39;m finally starting on in earnest. Check out sqlweld on <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/sqlweld">Github</a>!</p>
