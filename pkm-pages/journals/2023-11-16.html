    <p>I started a new project called &quot;Should have been a Blog Post,&quot; or SBBP for short. This application downloads a Youtube video, extracts screenshots every 10 seconds, and runs the audio through Whisper. The text is then presented alongside the screenshots, so you can just read through the transcript and see the visuals alongside, instead of needing to spend an hour watching a single video.</p>
    <p>Check it out <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/sbbp">on Github</a>.</p>
