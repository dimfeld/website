    <p>Not a lot of time spent coding this weekend due to Christmas and spending time with the kids, but I got a few things going on <a href="https://elk.zone/techhub.social/tags/PerceiveProject">#PerceiveProject</a>.</p>
    <p>The SQLite database is setup, and I have an import pipeline design that can process input from multiple sources.</p>
    <p>The first source is just plain text file scanning via the <code>ignore</code> and <code>globset</code> crates, which will be sufficient for much of my personal needs.</p>
    <p>Finally, I was able to implement the first stages of the import pipeline, which figure out if a scanned file has been changed or not from the previous scan.</p>
    <p>For Tuesday: writing new/changed entries to the database, generating embeddings, and a basic search functionality.</p>
