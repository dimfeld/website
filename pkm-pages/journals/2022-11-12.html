    <p>Today I wrote image reading and writing tests for  <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a>. I came across a number of issues reading AVIF files, which eventually were fixed by switching directly to the  <code>libavif</code>  crate which seems to do a better job parsing certain AVIF files that aren&#39;t quite up to spec.</p>
    <p>I also made a <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/imageinfo-rs">fork of the `imageinfo` crate</a> to help with detecting these files, but I need to go back and see if my fix is really correct before I submit it upstream.</p>
