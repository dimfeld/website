        <li>Hillel Wayne recently wrote an <a href="https://github.com/readme/guides/testable-requirements-feedback">article for Github README on decision tables</a> as an entry into formal methods. I&#39;ve long been a fan of these kind of tables, and just today found it a useful technique for figuring out the desired behavior in a UI based on a few different pieces of state.</li>
        <li>Hillel wrote a much more comprehensive treatment of <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/decision-table-patterns/">decision tables and techniques for using them effectively</a> a couple years ago.</li>
