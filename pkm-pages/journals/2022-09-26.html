    <p>Almost finishing up the &quot;journal&quot; updates for the website, I added a monthly navigation sidebar. Will merge the PR once there&#39;s more than a single month to show. The final piece will be to add per-tag navigation to the same sidebar.</p>
    <p>I&#39;ve been really happy with the new SvelteKit changes from the past couple of months. The seamless integration of types between the frontend and backend and the easy ability to write server-only load functions specific to a page really make for a great development experience.</p>

        <li>Hillel Wayne recently wrote an <a href="https://github.com/readme/guides/testable-requirements-feedback">article for Github README on decision tables</a> as an entry into formal methods. I&#39;ve long been a fan of these kind of tables, and just today found it a useful technique for figuring out the desired behavior in a UI based on a few different pieces of state.</li>
        <li>Hillel also wrote a much more comprehensive treatment of <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/decision-table-patterns/">decision tables and techniques for using them effectively</a> a couple years ago.</li>
