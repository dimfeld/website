    <p>Got the <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a> bootstrap command working today. The Postgres ability to defer constraints checking until the end of a transaction is very handy here, when you&#39;re loading a bunch of JSON files and don&#39;t want to have to sort them topologically according to the foreign arrangement of the tables.</p>
    <p>I&#39;ve also been getting a steady stream of Github notification emails for the past hour, all from the same PR at work that someone else is working on. I had an idea a while back to make an <a href="/notes/projects_email_digest_service">Email Digest Service</a> and this is pushing me closer to doing just that. At least Pic Store is getting close enough to MVP that I can push through and start using it soon.</p>

    <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>AWS Route53 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html">lets you create &quot;alias&quot; records</a> that work like a CNAME, but just redirect to another AWS resource (including other Route53 entries). This incurs less cost than a normal CNAME, since resolving the alias doesn&#39;t count as an extra lookup.</p>
