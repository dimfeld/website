    <p>I&#39;m playing with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli">DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli</a> model a bit to do intent detection for Buzzy. The idea here is that I can figure out if I should do a web search to add some context to help answer a factual question, or maybe a bit of math, or if the question doesn&#39;t require any of that. First impressions are that it should work very well.</p>
