    <p>I initially was using <a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> for Buzzy, but had to switch back to Node until some Vite ecosystem issues are resolved. I really liked Bun though, and look forward to using it more in the future. And of course, the first thing I hit when going back to Node was an ESM issue ;)</p>
