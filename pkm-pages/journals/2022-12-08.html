  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>I released a new version of <a href="/notes/projects_effectum">Effectum</a> today, with support for altering or cancelling pending jobs. This will be a necessary item for the <a href="/notes/projects_email_digest_service">Email Digest Service</a> project, if I pursue it, since it will need to schedule a digest but then delay it as emails continue to come in.</li>

  </ul>
