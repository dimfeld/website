    <p>One of the best parts about tools like Phind is you can ask it a question, follow up with &quot;I&#39;m on a Mac and this didn&#39;t work&quot; and it will just tell you why.</p>
    <p>Turns out Mac tools often use libedit instead of readline, so your keybindings need to go in .editrc instead of .inputrc.</p>
