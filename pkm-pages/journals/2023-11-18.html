    <p>Added summarization to <a href="/notes/projects_sbbp">SBBP</a> . For long form stuff like summarizing video transcripts it seems like GPT3.5 still does a much better job than the open source models, and summarizing 5 videos today only cost me 2 cents. Perhaps I just haven&#39;t found the right local model for this task though.</p>
    <p>I also sped up the image similarity process by 100x, by just running it all in one Python execution instead of starting a new invocation for every checked pair of images.</p>
    <p>Overall I&#39;m really happy with how this is turning out. Still need to make the design better but it&#39;s already very useful for things like long conference talks.</p>
