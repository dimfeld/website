    <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>Today I read <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11322">StateFlow: Enhancing LLM Task-Solving through State-Driven Workflows</a>. This paper talks about using state machines to explicitly model the problem that an agent is trying to solve. They got great results, and I agree that it&#39;s a good way to go about solving a problem, but I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s really new here. Maybe it&#39;s just my background, but using state machines to direct the high-level behavior of your agent feels like a very obvious thing to do, and a lot of people in the LLM space have been talking about it for a while now.</p>
