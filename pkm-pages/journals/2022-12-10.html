  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>Another thing I&#39;m coming around to with Ergo possibility is a block-based design, similar to <a href="https://natto.dev">natto.dev</a>, but where everything can continue running on the server when you close the tab. This is slightly different from a state machine, more of a data flow type of thing, but fits well with the input-based model, and could probably reuse a lot of the UI design between the two.</li>
    <li>This also fits well with allowing some blocks to be tables and graphs, and these can be highlighted in a “view” mode and show up in some form in the dashboard as well.</li>

  </ul>
