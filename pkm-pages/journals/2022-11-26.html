    <p>Added a new article today about <a href="/writing/process_streaming_uploads_with_axum">processing streaming uploads with the Axum framework</a>, based on the image upload code I wrote for <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a>.</p>
    <p>I also wrote the <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/prefect/blob/master/prefect/examples/simple.rs">first example program</a> for <a href="/notes/projects_effectum">Effectum</a>. It&#39;s nice that Rust has built-in support for adding examples to a library.</p>
