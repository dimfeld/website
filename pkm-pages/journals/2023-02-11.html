    <p>Yet more changes to my publishing flow over the past two days. I added the ability to set custom HTML classes and elements in my Logseq page exporter, which lets me add nice custom styling like in the &quot;code and image&quot; pairs in the new <a href="/writing/introduction_to_geojson">Introduction to GeoJSON</a> article.</p>
    <p>And speaking of that article, it&#39;s live on the site now. This is targeted toward newcomers to the geographic data world, so if you are a beginner, then I hope it&#39;s useful, and if not, then expect additional content soon!</p>
