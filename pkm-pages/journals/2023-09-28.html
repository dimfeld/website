    <p>Today marks the end of my nine-year tenure with Carevoyance. It&#39;s been quite a ride with lots of ups and downs, but a great experience overall, and since the company has been handed over to H1 and scaled up, I&#39;ve been getting that &quot;founder itch&quot; to start something new.</p>
    <p>For the short term, I&#39;m going to take some time off and work on a bunch of side projects and other stuff, but will likely be back at it again before too long!</p>
