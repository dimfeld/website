    <p>Spent some time yesterday and today updating my <a href="https://docs.rs/sqlx-transparent-json-decode/latest/sqlx_transparent_json_decode">sqlx JSON companion crate</a> to support sqlx 0.7. I also added a type that makes it easier to get a Box&lt;RawValue&gt; out of the query.</p>
    <p>Also finally added tests! And wrote up some notes on using <a href="/notes/sqlx">JSON in sqlx</a>.</p>
