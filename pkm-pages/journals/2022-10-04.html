    <li>Implemented job insertion on <a href="/notes/projects_prefect">Prefect</a> today. I tried to be clever at first and prepare all the queries in advance when the Queue is created, but ran into issues where prepared <code>rusqlite</code> statements are not <code>Send</code>. That&#39;s ok though. The <code>rusqlite</code> prepared statement cache is close enough.</li>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/libsql/libsql">LibSQL</a> is a new SQLite fork. Whereas SQLite famously does not accept outside contributions, LibSQL is approaching it from a more community-based open source viewpoint. They&#39;re aiming toward some more &quot;modern&quot; features such as support of io_uring and perhaps WASM user-defined functions. We&#39;ll have to see how this turns out. SQLite&#39;s strict development process has also lead to a famously stable product, and I expect that it will be difficult to keep that same level of rigor. Still, if this picks up steam it could be quite promising.</li>
