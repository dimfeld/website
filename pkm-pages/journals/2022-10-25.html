  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>Michael Lynch&#39;s post today on <a href="https://mtlynch.io/notes/cypress-vs-playwright/">migrating from Cypress to Playwright</a> struck a chord with me, as I had recently been setting up Cypress at work and encountered many of the same pain points that he mentioned. Having tried Playwright now, I&#39;m a fan.</li>
    <li>Github Copilot continues to be quite nice. It even appears to be aware of multiple buffers at once. When I was converting my Cypress tests, it actually suggested a nearly proper Playwright equivalent. Very impressive, and it saved me at least five minutes per test.</li>
