    <p>I finished up the integration between <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a> and my Logseq exporter today.</p>
    <p>I&#39;m caching the image URLs for speed, and it can also look up from Pic Store by hash to avoid duplicate uploads. One nice thing about already having an SQLite database set up for utilities like this is that it becomes easy to add additional tables.</p>
    <p>And for good measure, here&#39;s an image that I dragged into Logseq, was uploaded by the exporter, and is now being served from the image CDN. This was generated while playing around with Stable Diffusion over the Thanksgiving break, and is being served as a WebP, AVIF, or JPEG depending on your browser support.</p>
