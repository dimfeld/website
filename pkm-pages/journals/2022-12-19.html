    <p>The image in last night&#39;s post was too compressed by <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a>. I updated the webp compressor to use a higher quality setting, and also added a new endpoint that can rerun the conversion process without needing to upload the image again. Nice and simple when you can just trigger it with an easy-to-use background job framework.</p>
    <p>Final work on the <a href="/notes/projects_ergo">Ergo</a> dataflow backend is done for now, and I can start on the UI for real. I&#39;m looking at <a href="https://github.com/PuruVJ/neodrag/">NeoDrag</a> and <a href="https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows">Perfect Arrows</a> to help with some of that. I&#39;ll probably roll the infinite canvas code myself, which I think won&#39;t be too hard but we&#39;ll see.</p>
    <p>Finally, I have some extended time off next week, so I&#39;m considering taking a break from my normal side projects to play around with embeddings and semantic search. Looks like there are a bunch of Rust crates such as rust-bert and hnsw_rs that should let me make good progress quickly.</p>
