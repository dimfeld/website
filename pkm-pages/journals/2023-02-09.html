    <p>I wrote 1,100 words on an intro to GeoJSON last night. The article is coming together and should be up soon once I make the content bit less dry :) This one is just the basics, but will set the stage for doing actual work.</p>
    <p>Did a bit more tonight, but I took a break to fix some CSS stuff on this site and update my <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/export-logseq-notes">Logseq exporter</a> to better support exporting longform writing. Now I can write blog posts in Logseq and still use the outline hierarchy to organize sections, but get flattened HTML output when I publish here.</p>
