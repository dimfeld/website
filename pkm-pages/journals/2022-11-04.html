  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>When it comes time to actually document code for public consumption, Rust&#39;s <code>missing_docs</code> lint is great. I don&#39;t have to search out every place that needs documentation; I can just let the compiler yell at me about it.</li>
    <li>In related news, <a href="/notes/projects_effectum">Effectum</a> first release is basically done. All the basic tests are there and I got a big performance improvement by batching database operations together, so it can process about 50,000 do-nothing jobs per second on my laptop. Going to clean some things up and then the first actual release should come early next week.</li>
    <li>Some future features will include auto-recurring jobs, the ability to cancel or modify jobs that haven&#39;t started running yet, and support for running the task queue as its own server.</li>

  </ul>
