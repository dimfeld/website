  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>Added support today for writing JPEGs and reading HEIC files. The HEIC input will need a bit of tweaking but it’s mostly there.</li>
    <li>Once the <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a> MVP is wrapped up I’m going to add support for it to my Logseq exporter, and then maybe implement the server mode for <a href="/notes/projects_prefect">Prefect</a>.</li>
    <li>As for the public project roadmap, I think Linear is the way to go there. Should be easy enough to pull down the issues from their API and add some pages here to display them.</li>

  </ul>
