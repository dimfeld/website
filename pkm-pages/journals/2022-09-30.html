    <p>Started up <a href="https://warp.dev">Warp Terminal</a> once again to check out the latest updated. The various displays in Neovim all look correct now, which is great. And the notifications on finishing of long-running commands is welcome, since I&#39;m frequently running long tasks in other tabs at work.</p>
    <p>They&#39;ve also added a quick session switcher (Cmd+Shift+P). Still would be nice to be able to switch between entire sets of tabs, like tmux lets you do, but I&#39;m ready to give it another serious try.</p>
