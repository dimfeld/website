    <p>Added support for semantic search on Browser bookmarks. It&#39;s very convenient that Chrome&#39;s metadata files are all just SQLite databases or JSON files.
I&#39;m thinking that bookmark management is going to become a first-class feature of Perceive, so you can get semantic search not only on bookmarks imported from the browser, but can add bookmarks inside the tool itself and search through them as well. So next up, going to try out a GUI in Tauri.</p>
