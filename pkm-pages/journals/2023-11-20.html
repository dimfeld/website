    <p>Updated <a href="/notes/projects_sbbp">SBBP</a> so that I can add videos directly from the app, and also queue up multiple videos for download. Whisper currently doesn&#39;t do great on technical terms, so that needs some improvement. I think there&#39;s a way to do that with OpenAI&#39;s API, but it&#39;s not obvious how to do it with the Huggingface high-level packages, so I may need to dive in to the internals some to see if that can be done.</p>
