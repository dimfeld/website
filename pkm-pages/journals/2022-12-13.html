  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>Didn&#39;t get much time to hack over the weekend, but I&#39;ve started on the server side of Ergo&#39;s dataflow model. The code to walk the DAG in topological order from any node  down to all the connected leaf nodes is done, and so the rest will build upon that.</li>
    <li>For the rest of the server side work, I &#39;m leveraging a lot of the existing task triggers and Javascript execution code. Then I can finally build some more tasks for Ergo than the one I currently have: a one-state state machine that runs youtube-dl for every payload it receives. :)</li>
    <li>For that existing task, I have an action set up in Drafts, so I can paste in URLs and it will call the Ergo endpoint once for each line in the document. Works nicely.</li>

  </ul>
