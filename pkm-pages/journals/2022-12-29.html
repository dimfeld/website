    <p>Got browser history searching done today. Chrome&#39;s history file is just a SQLite database so that was pretty easy to pull in.</p>
    <p>Lots of little details related to actually fetching the date, which aren&#39;t worth talking about too much and took up most of the day. I also revamped the import pipeline a bit to reduce head-of-line blocking when some requests take a while.</p>
    <p>With this done, the database contains about 13,000 items, and the HNSW search index takes a while to build. So I&#39;ll work on optimizing that tomorrow.</p>
