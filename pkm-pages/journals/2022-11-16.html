    <p>Copilot works well for writing repetitive CRUD endpoints in <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a>, but better is to not have to write them at all. I&#39;ve been <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/pic-store/commit/f28e9fd5167f584c678c123f6953d7bc8af7742b">experimenting with using macros</a> to abstract out the details of CRUD operations. This includes the relevant permissions checks, filtering on team/project, and so on.</p>
    <p>Seems to be working well so far, and it removes a lot of the boilerplate. I may take this a step further and generate the entire endpoint function with a macro, but I haven&#39;t decided yet.</p>

        <p>Speaking of boilerplate, Hillel Wayne recently wrote a short <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/why-do-we-call-it-boilerplate-code/">article on the origin of the term</a>.</p>
