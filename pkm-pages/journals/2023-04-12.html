    <p>I wrote a short essay yesterday titled <a href="/writing/are_llms_databases">Are LLMs Databases?</a>, and posted it up here too. Ultimately I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real comparison, but it&#39;s still a useful question to think about a bit.</p>
    <p>In more practical news, I&#39;ve been thinking about how using LLMs to generate SQL seems an especially potent way for existing applications to integrate LLMs and AI in a way thatâ€™s actually useful.</p>
    <p>Users ask the questions they care about, without having to wait for you to build the answer. The most popular questions can become full features. I&#39;ll likely be exploring this more in the future.</p>
