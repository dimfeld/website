    <p>The <a href="/writing/loading_geographic_data_in_a_format_you_can_actually_use">new article on loading geodata</a> is published and I&#39;m happy with how it turned out. Now I&#39;ve been starting on the Svelte MapLibre library.</p>
    <p>Today I got the basic map and simple marker support working. Tomorrow I&#39;m starting on real sources and layers, and along the way I&#39;m planning on some wrappers to make it easier to create fancy styles and shaders too.</p>
    <p>If you&#39;re interested in following the progress here, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/svelte-maplibre">Github Repo</a> or the <a href="https://svelte-maplibre.vercel.app/">Demo Site</a>.</p>
