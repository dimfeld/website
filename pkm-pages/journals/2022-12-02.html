    <p>Added conditional format conversions to <a href="/notes/projects_pic_store">Pic Store</a> today. This lets you configure it to do things like generate PNGs only if the input was also a PNG, so that you don&#39;t do silly things like output a PNG of a photo. Next up will be the Pic Store integration mentioned in the previous post.</p>
    <p>I also finally wrote a short README for my <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/remote-ssl-renewal">LetsEncrypt SSL renewer utility</a>.</p>

    <p><h3>Learning</h3></p>
        <p>Last night I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNRoR0Z3SzU">Join Order Optimization with (almost) no Statistics</a> by Tom Ebergen. In this video, Tom describes enhancements he made to the join planner in DuckDB, and how it applies both to native tables where you have some extra metadata about the contents of each column, and on external files such as Parquet or CSV, where you don&#39;t know much about the actual contents. Good watching if you have any interest in database systems.</p>
