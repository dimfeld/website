    <p>Added the ability in <a href="/notes/projects_promptbox">PromptBox</a> to append strings from the command line and from stdin in addition to what&#39;s in the prompt template. Next up will be ability to submit images to GPT4 vision and Ollama (once the pending PR for it is merged).</p>
    <p>I <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/promptbox/tree/master/prompts">uploaded some sample prompt templates</a> as well.</p>

        <li>Spent the weekend playing some with <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a> for downloading and processing medical device approval data from the FDA. It&#39;s a nice system; the data asset model and partitioning fits well with how I like to think about things. Definitely worth checking out if you need to write data pipelines of some complexity.</li>
