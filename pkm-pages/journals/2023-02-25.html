    <p>I&#39;ve made great progress on my <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/svelte-maplibre">Maplibre Svelte library</a>, enough so that it&#39;s basically ready for use and I&#39;m starting to move on to more advanced features such as new types of layers with custom shaders. Really happy with how this turned out and how easy it is to create great maps with Maplibre.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://svelte-maplibre.vercel.app/">Demo Site</a> has a lot more demos now, so check it out!</p>
    <p>I also created a small utility called <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/merge-geo">merge-geo</a>, which takes a GeoJSON file and related CSV files with information about the regions in the GeoJSON, and imports the CSV data into the GeoJSON. This comes up a lot when working with US Census data and similar sources, so it can save a lot of time.</p>
