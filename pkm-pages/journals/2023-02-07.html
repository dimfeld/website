    <li>I&#39;m thinking about doing some more content on working with geographic data. This would include topics such as GeoJSON, working with PostGIS, and writing full apps with SvelteKit and Leaflet. If there is anything that you&#39;ve found confusing or hard to learn in this area, let please reach out. My email is just <em class="italic">daniel</em> at this domain, and I&#39;m also on <a href="https://twitter.com/dimfeld">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://techhub.social/@dimfeld">Mastodon</a>.</li>
    <li>In other news, I haven&#39;t been posting updates on <a href="/notes/projects_ergo">Ergo</a> recently, but the dataflow model is working. Still needs a bit more work to generate type definitions for the editors and for more visualizations, but the core functionality is there.</li>
