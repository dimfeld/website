  <ul class="list-document">
    
    <li>Thinking about how to better represent the progress and plans for my various projects. I moved a lot of my internal TODO lists over to Github issues, which works all right, and I can even create a view that shows issues from multiple repositories at once. This is especially nice now that I&#39;m building up a small eco system of projects, some of which are using others as dependencies.</li>
    <li>I also tried <a href="https://linear.app">Linear</a> briefly and while I love the interface, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to &quot;build in public&quot; with it. So I&#39;m torn about that. Maybe I&#39;ll make a small program to export issues from the API and write out some Markdown with the project status, which I can then publish here.</li>

  </ul>
