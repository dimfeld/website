    <p>Progress on <a href="/notes/projects_effectum">Effectum</a> is coming along as I find a couple hours here and there to work on it. Job heartbeat and checkpoint functionality is written. Next up will be some thought about ergonomic ways to start workers that can run multiple types of tasks. I may do something inspired by the job registry in <a href="https://github.com/Diggsey/sqlxmq">sqlxmq</a>.</p>

        <li>Haki Benita wrote a short article about writing <a href="https://hakibenita.com/future-proof-sql">SQL in a future-proof way</a> by adding exhaustive checking to CASE statements. This way if an unexpected new value is added to a column, a query will throw an error instead of just ignoring it.</li>
