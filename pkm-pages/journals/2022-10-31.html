    <li><a href="/notes/projects_effectum">Effectum</a> tests are underway and progress has been good so far. Found a couple issues but nothing major. It&#39;ll be nice to have this done and have a background job framework with no external dependencies, ready to drop into any future project.</li>

        <li>Ran into a issue today with a Svelte component that dispatches an event when it first loads. It turns out that if you dispatch immediately then the event doesn&#39;t get handled, but you can work around this by dispatching in <code>onMount</code> instead. I created <a href="https://svelte.dev/repl/51a5cf55b7254cfa9425d8076f36e8cf?version=3.52.0">this example Svelte REPL</a> to demonstrate the behavior.</li>
