    <p>One really nice thing about <a href="https://just.systems/man/en/">Just</a> is that you can embed scripts directly into the justfile. Obviously larger scripts should still be separate files, but for scripts just a few lines long, it&#39;s really nice to have that flexibility and not have to create a separate file.</p>
