      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Fixed some issues with <a href="https://github.com/dimfeld/svelte-maplibre">svelte-maplibre</a> and Mapbox&#39;s Draw plugin today. Both of these turned out to be general incompatibilities with Maplibre, where the Mapbox plugin (understandably) assumed the presence of certain Mapbox CSS classes. I released v0.9.9 of the package which includes some new CSS which allows the mouse pointers to work properly in Maplibre. And an <a href="https://svelte-maplibre.vercel.app/examples/draw">example is also now up on the website</a>.</li>
      </ul>
