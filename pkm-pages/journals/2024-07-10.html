    <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>Today I presented a review of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11584">The Landscape of Emerging AI Agent Architectures for Reasoning, Planning, and Tool Calling: A Survey</a> at the Latent Space paper club. While it wasn&#39;t recorded, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EH11pXLanLMoLGEXd_YduYxEEk3X2Y63KOOFsysq1LY">my slides are published on Google Slides</a>.</p>
