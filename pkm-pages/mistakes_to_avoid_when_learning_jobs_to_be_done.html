  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li id="vLgex6ilX">Don’t think of it as a framework or a method with a set of steps.
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="2fRMMC6rV">JTBD is a theory. It’s something you learn to understand how things have happened, and to make predictions about the future.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="wQ9hI7g8a">Don’t persuade others about how great JTBD is
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="5_skQQyUV">In the style of JTBD itself, focus on how great people will be if they use JTBD.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="4cM8StRt4">Don’t use it as a design process
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="hOegUS8a5">It can inform design processes, but it is not a replacement for it. JTBD helps you gather and model data to describe the demand for your products, but does not tell you what to do about it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="WBrM50oUb">Don’t think of a job as a task
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="xd1QakWjd">A task is something that is done but doesn’t tell you anything about how it changes the person doing it. A JTBD is a desire for progress.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="_H3LRuhOb">Don’t study how people use products.
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="OF9osuzfC">We care less about how people use a product and more about <strong class="rm-bold">why</strong> they started using it in the first place.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
