        <li id="FcJp7K-XR">This is looking at how countries develop. They go up a series of multiple s-curves.</li>
        <li id="KaYSyrqeG">Countries just starting to industrialize often start with textiles or something similar that anyone can do and has been done for centuries preceding industrialization. Over time the country gets about as much growth as it can from textiles, but in the meantime the populace is richer and more educated, and there are resources to get into the next, more complex but also more profitable, thing.</li>
        <li id="UnhLSg6ms">So they move on to things like steel, and then from there on to automobiles, and so on. At the beginning of the curve things are not so great but you improve over time. E.g. Japanese cars from 50 years ago weren&#39;t very good but now they&#39;re among the best in the world.</li>
        <li id="Bv2FfFoFp">What happens as you move up the next s-curve is that a lot of your current s-curve industries start to come from trade with other countries.</li>
      </ul>

        <li id="TrIoUn7sd">Patrick&#39;s version about moving between businesses. You start out with something really simple that isn&#39;t actually a great business, but it gives you experience to move on to the next thing.</li>
        <li id="iyxkYdVcV">This was at the time that Patrick was starting Starfighter, and he couldn&#39;t have done that without doing Appointment Reminder before, and Bingo Card Creator before that.</li>

        <li id="-OyugvmJH">People tell you that you are especially good at something</li>
        <li id="S1Cfs1LiO">People say something is especially hard, but you happen to find it easy.</li>

            <li id="LoY6jDfEu">$99 a month for SaaS application access. This won&#39;t exist right away but is the transition plan to open up to the downmarket as the business gains steam and you&#39;re ready to scale.</li>
