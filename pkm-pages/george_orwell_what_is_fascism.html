        <li id="gqnOt2pr4">Even in the 40s there was considerable disagreement in popular discourse  about the nature of fascism. Just as we see today, both the left and the right we&#39;re calling each other fascist. </li>
        <li id="Jg5rd1Cba"><blockquote class="rm-bq"> It will be seen that, as used, the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley&#39;s broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else.</blockquote></li>
        <li id="gvm0h1pXO">Orwell gives up on defining the word outside of the strict boundaries of Fascism as formal type of governing, because it&#39;s impossible to craft a definition that would be agreed upon by all sides. As he says, the word is more reduced to &quot;bully&quot; or anyone the utterer dislikes. </li>
        <li id="llzP87Iz2"><blockquote class="rm-bq">All one can do for the moment is to use the word with a certain amount of circumspection and not, as is usually done, degrade it to the level of a swearword.</blockquote></li>
