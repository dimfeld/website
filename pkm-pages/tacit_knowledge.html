    <li>Why Tacit Knowledge is More Important than Deliberate Practice
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Tacit knowledge is knowledge that can&#39;t be captured through words alone.</li>
        <li>You can try to tell someone how to do the task but that is insufficient for them to actually learn it.</li>
        <li>These kinds of skills are better taught through imitation and practice. Seeing examples and performing the task under a guide goes a long way where words fail.</li>
        <li>This applies most obviously to physical tasks, but it also is a valuable concept in knowledge-based tasks.</li>
        <li>People skilled at programming, stock trading, or other tasks may be able to show you their knowledge and provide answers, but be unable to provide a explanation that actually teaches others how to arrive at the same conclusion in a similar case.
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>In these cases, they can often explain the specific features and tradeoffs they evaluated in a particular decision, but the underlying principles used to make those evaluations are harder to express in a way that really teaches them to others.</li>
            <li>Those underlying principles are also often filled with exceptions and small, but important, details that have been learned over the years. A skilled practitioner uses these details when making a decision, but consciously recalling them in a teaching scenario is more difficult.</li>
            <li>A good sign that someone is using tacit knowledge to make an decision is when their explanation is accompanied by a long list of caveats and exceptions that they used to make it.</li>
            <li>Atul Gawande tells a story about appendicitis surgery. As surgeries go it&#39;s a pretty common thing, but there are still a wide variety of approaches to take and decisions to make, depending on the patient&#39;s body, how easy it is to find and extract the appendix, and numerous other details.
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>This story in no way prepares someone to perform surgery, but it illuminates that surgery is full of tacit knowledge.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Teaching Tacit Knowledge
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>The Holy Grail of this would be to be able to make tacit knowledge explicit in some way so that everyone could take advantage of it without extensive practice.</li>
            <li>Many have tried to do this, whether through creating flowcharts, computer systems, or books. The consensus is that it&#39;s very difficult to do this effectively. There are just too many little details that a human expert has internalized but wouldn&#39;t necessarily recall in an interview without specific prompting.</li>
            <li>These kinds of systems for teaching tacit knowledge also tend to prevent the development of tacit knowledge. Because someone following a flowchart is not really thinking for themselves, they don&#39;t engage the parts of their brain that would encode exceptions and variations on rule.</li>
            <li>There are some rare cases where tacit knowldge has been successfully expressed.
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Gary Klein developed a technique called Critical Decision Method (CDM) which seems to work well, but is also difficult to perform.</li>
                <li>John Boyd developed an Air Force manual for dogfighting, previously thought to be impossible.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some place hope in AI systems for better encoding the various exceptions and when they apply through learning over massive datasets.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Learning Tacit Knowledge
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>The problem with applying deliberate practice to tacit knowledge is that deliberate practie requires an understood task with well-encoded rules. Fields that are made up largely of tacit knowledge are not well-suited to this.</li>
            <li>Apprenticeships work well here.</li>
            <li>Naturalistic Decision Making is the study of how to tacit knowledge is learned, and it is overvied in <strong class="font-bold">The Oxford Handbook of Expertise</strong>.</li>
