      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li id="XchsQ4u5J">Tacit knowledge is knowledge that can&#39;t be captured through words alone.</li>
        <li id="KrHTQstkw">You can try to tell someone how to do the task but that is insufficient for them to actually learn it.</li>
        <li id="N3iJJBVjv">These kinds of skills are better taught through imitation and practice. Seeing examples and performing the task under a guide goes a long way where words fail.</li>
        <li id="Ik23Qk7Ed">This applies most obviously to physical tasks, but it also is a valuable concept in knowledge-based tasks. </li>
        <li id="838KFP8tg">People skilled at programming, stock trading, or other tasks may be able to show you their knowledge and provide answers, but be unable to provide a explanation that actually teaches others how to arrive at the same conclusion in a similar case.
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li id="NjZCyycH4">In these cases, they can often explain the specific features and tradeoffs they evaluated in a particular decision, but the underlying principles used to make those evaluations are harder to express in a way that really teaches them to others.</li>
            <li id="voMhc0Ual">Those underlying principles are also often filled with exceptions and small, but important, details that have been learned over the years. A skilled practitioner uses these details when making a decision, but consciously recalling them in a teaching scenario is more difficult.</li>
            <li id="czsF6qTjf">A good sign that someone is using tacit knowledge to make an decision is when their explanation is accompanied by a long list of caveats and exceptions that they used to make it.</li>
            <li id="dlTY71whB">Atul Gawande tells a story about appendicitis surgery. As surgeries go it&#39;s a pretty common thing, but there are still a wide variety of approaches to take and decisions to make, depending on the patient&#39;s body, how easy it is to find and extract the appendix, and numerous other details. 
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li id="e8bglWz-A">This story in no way prepares someone to perform surgery, but it illuminates that surgery is full of tacit knowledge.</li>
              </ul>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li id="T9lNqiIqm">The Holy Grail of this would be to be able to make tacit knowledge explicit in some way so that everyone could take advantage of it without extensive practice.</li>
            <li id="X5D3CE49r">Many have tried to do this, whether through creating flowcharts, computer systems, or books. The consensus is that it&#39;s very difficult to do this effectively. There are just too many little details that a human expert has internalized but wouldn&#39;t necessarily recall in an interview without specific prompting.</li>
            <li id="139ej9fkB">These kinds of systems for teaching tacit knowledge also tend to prevent the development of tacit knowledge. Because someone following a flowchart is not really thinking for themselves, they don&#39;t engage the parts of their brain that would encode exceptions and variations on rule.</li>
            <li id="Zb8wj15QK">There are some rare cases where tacit knowldge has been successfully expressed.
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li id="T4ADuue1l">Gary Klein developed a technique called Critical Decision Method (CDM) which seems to work well, but is also difficult to perform.</li>
                <li id="2zALs1Us4">John Boyd developed an Air Force manual for dogfighting, previously thought to be impossible.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="nHb_9poSu">Some place hope in AI systems for better encoding the various exceptions and when they apply through learning over massive datasets. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="hB3ueiHVt"><span class="rm-heading-2">Learning Tacit Knowledge</span>
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li id="pQMGG817W">The problem with applying deliberate practice to tacit knowledge is that deliberate practie requires an understood task with well-encoded rules. Fields that are made up largely of tacit knowledge are not well-suited to this.</li>
            <li id="4E-Wz2Z35">Apprenticeships work well here.</li>
