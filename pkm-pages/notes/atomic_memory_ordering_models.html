    <li><span><span class="font-medium text-gray-800">Source:</span> <span><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html">Atomics - The Rustonomicon</a>, <a href="https://jeehoonkang.github.io/2017/08/23/synchronization-patterns.html">Relaxed-Memory Concurrency Synchronization Patterns | From Pencil to Metal</a></span></span></li>
    <li>This mostly focuses on Rust&#39;s model, which is in turn derived from the C++20 model.</li>
    <li>Acquire and Release
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>These modes are usually paired, with one thread doing an Acquire, running some code, and then doing a Release.</li>
        <li>The Acquire ensures all writes after the Acquire are not reordered before it.</li>
        <li>The Release ensures that all writes before the Release are not reordered after it.</li>
        <li>This is useful for lock-free algorithms, where you want to ensure that the data is visible to the other thread when you release the lock.</li>
        <li>Generally the reader will then Acquire the same memory location before doing its reads, to ensure that it sees all the writes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>AcqRel
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>This is a combination of <code>Acquire</code> and <code>Release</code>. When doing an atomic store in <code>AcqRel</code> mode, any other thread that does an <code>Acquire</code> or <code>AcqRel</code> atomic load from that location will be guaranteed to see all writes to other locations that took place before the first thread&#39;s atomic write.</li>
        <li>This is most useful when your thread needs to both read data written by another thread, and write its own data.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>SeqCst</code>
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>This mode is similar to <code>AcqRel</code>, but also ensures that all threads will see all <code>SeqCst</code> operations in the same order. This is rarely necessary. (See <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/nomicon/issues/166">SeqCst as a default atomic ordering considered harmful · Issue #166 · rust-lang/nomicon</a> for a good explanation.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Relaxed
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Relaxed operations provide no guarantees about ordering of other memory accesses.</li>
        <li>This means that you can use it for atomic read-modify-write operations on a single memory location, but not to synchronize accesses to other data.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
