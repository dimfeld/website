  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li><a href="https://web.dev/content-visibility/">https://web.dev/content-visibility/</a></li>
    <li>This is a CSS attribute that tells to browser to forego full rendering of offscreen elements. Useful for things like big lists.</li>
    <li>The attribute only takes effect if the entire element is offscreen, so in a list it should be applied to each item in the list instead of the container.</li>
    <li>Use with <code>contain-intrinsic-size: 1000px</code> where the height there is the expected size of the element.</li>
  </ul>
