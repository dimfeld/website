    <li><h2>Incremental Execution</h2>
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>Using incremental execution for realtime machine learning
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>They were looking at storing unstructured data in the database and extracting data from it using a model.</li>
            <li>The data ends up in separate columns in the same row as the unstructured data, with confidence values for each one.</li>
            <li>Their UI then lets you do corrections which feed back into the model and immediately recalculate values from it.</li>
            <li>This then feeds into incremental materialized views that update only the parts which need updating.</li>
          </ul>        </li>
        <li>Incremental stream processing with Differential Datalog.

            <li>VMWare was running queries to check consistency constraints within their networks.</li>
            <li>For better performance they wanted to have queries that update incrementally, on only the data that has changed.</li>
            <li>On top of Datalog, they added more data types such as structs and collections, and fragments of imperative code as well.</li>
            <li>Theyâ€™re compiling DDLog to use differential dataflow for the compute engine, and are now working on their own compute engine.</li>
          </ul>        </li>
      </ul>    </li>
    <li>Airtable
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>GUI vs SQL</li>
        <li>No need for extra join table for many-to-many relationships. It&#39;s handled in the background
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>probably by all relationships being many to many internally? Or just array fields maybe, but then the hiding ofthe implementation is the point.</li>
          </ul>        </li>
        <li>The nice thing about Airtable is that the GUI primitives turn into a cheap business logic without much effort and no real GUI-building required.</li>
        <li>Unlike a spreadsheet, you&#39;re still using database concepts such as actual relations between rows in tables and uniqueness constraints, which makes things more scalable and prevents the all-too-familiar gigantic unmaintainable Excel spreadsheet.</li>
        <li>You can add triggers to perform certain tasks in the database when changing certain pieces of data.
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>The trigger scripts can be actual Javascript with access to a full API.</li>
          </ul>        </li>
      </ul>    </li>
    <li>Ultorg: a user interface for relational databases
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>This is a general purpose database application, but with better priimitives for building functionality on top of it than the normal database tool.</li>
        <li>Can show data for joins on each row.</li>
      </ul>    </li>
  </ul>
