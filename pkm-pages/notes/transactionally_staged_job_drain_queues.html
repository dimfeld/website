    <li>For transactions that need to enqueue background jobs it&#39;s useful to not talk directly to the job queue, but to add your jobs to a table and have another process that periodically sweeps that table and enqueues the jobs in it.</li>
    <li>This way you can do more work in SQL transactions, and the the job queueing can just be another part of the transaction.</li>
