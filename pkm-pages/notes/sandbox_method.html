            <li>A sandbox is a low stakes place where you can easily play with new techniques and expand your skills.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Research.
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Starting out, look for recipes, clear ways of using the skill that you can easily try out in the sandbox.</li>
            <li>consider publishing your notes. The work that goes into making your notes consumable by others will also be helpful when you come back to them later.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Practice it
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>to really improve, you need to push your boundaries. Not just casually going over the same things over and over again, but challenging yourself and ideally getting feedback.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Get feedback</li>
        <li>Continue the loop
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>once you have this process set up, just repeat it to improve even more.</li>
          </ul>
