    <p>One thing you&#39;ll see as you start to work with international mapping data is that the fields tend to be named generic things like <code>admin2</code>. This seems odd at first, but is a method to add some amount of consistency between countries. In this article we&#39;ll look at how administrative boundaries differ and are represented in mapping data, and then look at various types of official and unofficial regions used in the United States.</p>
    <h2>Worldwide values </h2>
        <p>Most countries divide their regions into multiple levels, but the names for these regions are not the same. Canada has provinces, the USA has states, and Honduras has <em class="italic">departamentos</em>. Map providers account for this by using names for the divisions which are not very descriptive, but can be used throughout the world.</p>
        <p>These official divisions of countries are called administrative regions or administrative divisions. Administrative divisions are distinguished by level, and each one corresponds to the level of the division in a country, irrespective of how it compares to that of other countries.</p>
        <p>There are usually up to four administrative region levels, but it varies by country. The first level corresponds to states, provinces, and so on. The second level may correspond to counties or districts in countries that use them. The third level may be cities. This isn&#39;t a hard and fast rule though &mdash; it&#39;s very much dependent on how a particular country divides itself up.</p>
        <p>Iceland is a simple case. Its level one division is 64 municipalities across the country, and there are no further official levels.</p>
        <p>The Philippines uses four levels of division. The first level is just called the &quot;region&quot;, and the second level consists of provinces or districts, and also &quot;independent cities&quot; which are geographically located inside a province but don’t officially belong to it. The third level then consists of cities and municipalities inside provinces, and the fourth level is the <em class="italic">barangay</em>, which is something like a neighborhood but with its own small government.</p>
        <p>Independent cities usually don&#39;t have a level three division, as they go straight to the <em class="italic">barangay</em>, so map creators will often just create a dummy level three division which has the same name and size as the city.</p>
        <p>Canada has ten provinces, each of which has a different way of splitting itself up.</p>
        <p>All this is to say that administrative divisions vary widely as you look at different places around the world. So the simple numbering of divisions was done with good reason.</p>
        <p>In mapping data these levels are usually designated <code>admin0</code> for the country, <code>admin1</code> for the first level of divisions, <code>admin2</code> for the second level, and so on. Again, the exact meaning of these is particular to the country.</p>
        <p>Each region will have a unique ID that identifies it in addition to the name, for continuity across name changes and to help when joining to other data. The ID values for a country&#39;s regions are often managed by that country&#39;s government, so different sources of geographic data can all share the same set of IDs.</p>

    <h2>Unofficial Divisions </h2>
        <p>Administrative divisions reflect political boundaries, but there are many unofficial types of divisions used as well. I live in the United States, so I&#39;ll use it for these example, but most other countries have their own versions of these ideas.</p>
        <p>The USA is officially divided into states, counties, and cities and towns. Some states have variations, such as Virginia&#39;s independent cities, similar to the Philippines example from above.</p>
        <p>Mapping with these types of regions is useful because they reflect governmental boundaries and people living in those areas are familiar with them, but they aren&#39;t always convenient for statistical analysis. In the San Francisco Bay Area, you can drive through three counties in less than an hour with no clear delineation between them. The towns of Palo Alto and Mountain View are in separate counties, but you wouldn&#39;t know it without a map.</p>
        <p>So what other kinds of regions do we have?</p>
        <h3>Census Regions </h3>
            <p>Beyond the administrative divisions, the US Census maintains additional breakdowns. These are useful for research and statistical purposes both because they correspond more to areas where people actually live, and because they can be changed occasionally as population patterns shift throughout the country.</p>
            <p>At the highest level, the Census groups the states into four regions, and each region is made up of two or three divisions. These regions don&#39;t come up too often.</p>
            <p>Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) are centered around an urban area with at least 50,000 people. These areas commonly encompass more than one city, such as the Los Angeles-Long Beach MSA, and also include surrounding areas from where people commute. Large MSAs are sometimes broken into Metropolitan Divisions as well.</p>

            <p>A Micropolitan Statistical Area (sometimes abbreviated <em class="italic">μSA</em>) is similar, but covers urban areas with between 10,000 and 50,000 people.</p>
            <p>These two types of areas together are called Core-Based Statistical Areas, or CBSAs, and adjacent CBSAs. Rural areas of the USA may not be in any CBSA, due to the lower limit of 10,000 people on Micropolitan areas.</p>
            <p>There are also 172 Combined Statistical Areas in the USA, which are groups of adjacent CBSAs. The New York–Newark CSA is comprised of seven individual CBSAs.</p>

            <p>At the local level, the US Census divides counties into Census Tracts, which are not administrative divisions, but sized to contain between 1,200 to 8,000 people each. These regions&#39; boundaries are relatively stable to enable better statistical comparison over time, but they do occasionally change in response to drastic population shifts. Tracts are further divided into block groups, areas of between roughly 600 to 3,000 people.</p>

        <h3>ZIP Codes </h3>
            <p>ZIP Codes are a complex topic unto themselves. We think of them as areas, but they are technically just a collection of mail delivery routes or links to a primary mail distribution center, and do not officially represent an actual area.</p>
            <p>This presents a challenge since ZIP codes are used for a lot of other purposes, so the US Census has created the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html">ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)</a> as a solution. They mostly are the same as ZIP codes, but there are a few differences.</p>
            <p>ZCTAs are defined by the most frequently occurring ZIP code in a census block group. A block group may occasionally have more than one ZIP code, so a handful of addresses are in a ZCTA that does not match the ZIP code. ZCTAs can also be expanded to cover small areas that have no ZIP code, and there may not be a ZCTA for &quot;unique&quot; ZIP codes which are assigned to a single large institution or building.</p>

        <h3>Other Region Types</h3>
            <p>Legislative Districts are another common mapping case. These determine who represents a particular area a branch of the government, and are often a source of controversy as they are continually redrawn in ways that shift voting patterns toward one party or another.</p>
            <p>Healthcare researchers commonly use geographic data in their work, and the Dartmouth Atlas of Health has created their own set of divisions in the USA. They have created 306 Healthcare Referral Regions (HRRs) which to group people by where they tend to go for more complex procedures and surgery, and 3,436 Healthcare Service Areas (HSAs) which group together populations by where they receive hospitalizations.</p>
            <p>You can usually get shapefiles from them somewhere in case you want to <a href="/writing/loading_geographic_data_in_a_format_you_can_actually_use">use them in an application</a>.</p>

        <p>In this post we covered administrative regions and various types of regions in the USA. With this knowledge you should be able to start finding the data for your own applications. Next in the series, we&#39;ll start building web applications that can visualize various types of geographic data on a map.</p>
